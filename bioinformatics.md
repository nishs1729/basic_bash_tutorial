## Methods to create phylogenetic trees

1. **Distance-Based Methods**: These methods rely on calculating a matrix of pairwise distances between taxa based on genetic or other similarity measures.

   * UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)
      * **[Youtube] [The UPGMA algorithm for distance-based tree construction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=061ukTACDvY)**
      * **[Youtube] [Creating a phylogenetic tree (UPGMA mathod)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09eD4A_HxVQ)** 

   * Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
      - **[Youtube] [The Neighbour Joining algorithm for phylogenetic tree estimation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tn90VWGmV4)**

2. **Character-Based Methods**: These methods analyze discrete characters, such as nucleotide or amino acid sequences.

   * **Maximum Parsimony**: Identifies the tree requiring the fewest evolutionary changes (mutations).
      * **[Youtube] [Parsimony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0iAm-JQcrs)**
   * **Maximum Likelihood**: Based on a probabilistic model of sequence evolution.
   * **Bayesian Inference**: Similar to maximum likelihood but uses prior probabilities and updates them with observed data to compute posterior probabilities.
